\section{Actor Memory Overhead Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}

  Our concept is based on the usage of hundreds of thousands of \glspl{dactor}, which all store only a small amount of data.
  This raises the question of how much memory overhead is introduced for storing data split across a multitude of actors.
  Therefore, we performed experiments comparing the memory usage of an exemplary actor database system with that of just loading the data into our data storage abstraction, called relations.
