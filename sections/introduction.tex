\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
\subsection{Motivation}
  % existing db landscape: KV-stores and RDBMS
  % tradeoffs of these two
  % motivational statement about importance of parallelization for data processing [sources]
  % data processing close to data storage [sources]
  
  % summarize chapters \ref{sec:dactors} and \ref{sec:actor_database_systems} in 2-3 sentences

\subsection{Contribution}
  % can we propose our framework?
  % our idea: domain-level object actor db in a framework
  % business logic defined as part of data tier using framework
  % QUESTION TO TORSTEN: de-facto this is disputable as our framework is more of a application dev framework, so arguably we push data tier into app tier
